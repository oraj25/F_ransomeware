# F_ransomeware
This is my first attempt at creating malware in a safe and controlled environment (using Kali Linux VM). The goal of this project was to understand:     How ransomware locks the screen     How it displays a ransom message     How it simulates file encryption     How it uses threads and timers     How the user input can simulate decryption.
