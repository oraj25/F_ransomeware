# F_ransomeware
This is my first attempt at creating malware in a safe and controlled environment (using Kali Linux VM). 
The goal of this project was to understand:     
How ransomware locks the screen     
How it displays a ransom message     
How it simulates file encryption    
How it uses threads and timers     
How the user input can simulate decryption.  
⚠️ This is not real malware. It does not encrypt any critical system files and is built purely for learning purposes in a virtual environment.
